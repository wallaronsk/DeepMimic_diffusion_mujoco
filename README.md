# DiffMimic

This is Kenji's final year project with diffusion models. Project direction is not clear yet.

Code was originally forked from DeepMimic, I have since moved all unused code into the archive folder.
Main code to pay attention to is in the diffusion folder.

## Quickstart

### Setup

Setup the conda environment with the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now you are able to run the notebooks
